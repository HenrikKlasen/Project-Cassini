# Project-Cassini
Low-Code-Web Editor

## Project idea
The idea behind Cassini is to be a well usable, easy to use, open-source Website creation and maintenance tool for simplifying the creation of websites.
The tool will include a Drag'n'Drop user interface for building a website (to make it as easy as building lego).

## Project execution

The project will be written mainly in C++ (and auxiliary libraries for GUI.)
Details on execution command and executables will follow once a running release can be done (or the project is in a non-"Hello World" state, as this is my first C++-Experience)
